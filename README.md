# Data-Camp
This is a repository contatining material that I have encountered during the completion of Data Camp resources. Most of the code has been indeed written by me, 
but it has been originally formulated by the data camp team. Hence, the credit does indeed go to them. Of course, there are modifications/altercations made by me 
and as well comments/explanation to aid my understanding better. 

The purpose of the repository is to no loose the details of implementation with the passing of time (which is almost sure to happen without some sort of reminder (this
repo)). As a result, I intend to use it a as refresher and reference for future projects, sort of a mini internet ;)
